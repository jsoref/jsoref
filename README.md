# Spelling

I'm developing [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/art/master/logo/spell-check.png" width="16" height="16">check-spelling](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling),
a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to reduce the prevalence of typos in GitHub repositories.

See [how it works](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Showcase).

# Contributions

I work on a number of projects.
I contribute to projects I don't use in addition to products that I'm using.
Sometimes I'll make a small contribution because I'm considering using a project.

# Forks

I keep lots of forks of other's repositories,
in general, you probably don't want to :star: Star or :fork_and_knife: Fork most of my repositories.
